todo:

see which of the bayes problems actually work / which should be removed

weather is good

P(H|D) = P(D|H) * P(H)

P(H|D) --> P(cave|good weather) 

P(D|H) --> P(good weather|cave) 
P(D|H) --> P(good weather|tavern)


80% of the days he's in the cave, the weather is good.
20% of the days he's in )))

P(good weather AND cave) = P(cave|good ewather)
P(good weather AND tavern)

P(cave|good weather) = P(cave and good weather) / P(good weather)
Weather is good so
