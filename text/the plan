moneybag:


======

new bias: small sample effect
new chapter: distributions
let people predict the outcome from an experiment
predict from a sequence of experiments

=====

default effect: can be made into a unit
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_effect


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insensitivity_to_sample_size



======

bayesian spreading:
bayesian spreading out of distribution

(1)
second best guess
mike -- that spreads out

(2)
choose a distribution
manipulate it
guessing game

scale everything up 1000


======

CIA world fact book


row of greyed out moneybags -- click a moneybag to submit your bet
submit

drag an existing moneybag


---

Make at least two guesses
If X isnt' the answer, what is the answer?
Choose a distribution that covers it

todo:

see which of the bayes problems actually work / which should be removed

weather is good

P(H|D) = P(D|H) * P(H)

P(H|D) --> P(cave|good weather) 

P(D|H) --> P(good weather|cave) 
P(D|H) --> P(good weather|tavern)


80% of the days he's in the cave, the weather is good.
20% of the days he's in )))

P(good weather AND cave) = P(cave|good ewather)
P(good weather AND tavern)

P(cave|good weather) = P(cave and good weather) / P(good weather)
Weather is good so 


adding hte click outside
make dropdown work better


---

stopped here: 

put in bayes widget
add moneybag unit


fix the text to make sense given the current ordering -- what should the current ordering be??


--

moneybag
bayes
belief as graphs

--

put in followup / signup page / thanks
figure out where we want to put the tests

---

too long and grindy
feedback from the google form:
do put in lower and upper bounds for the draggy thing
remove the google form
people didn't understand how it helps cog biases
bonus levels for bayes rule
unit problems for uncertainty questions

----

stopped here:
improve the story
make themoneybag into a "game"
feedback for user scores
unify the bayes colors with the distribution colors



stopped here:
figure out how to combine pset with a flow of questions

input-box is triggering next


---
ohh there is no higher pset within beliefs-as-dists....
pset is within!

---

how pset currently works:

- each child component calls pset.next() by looking up the DOM tree for the pset component

but now we have a hidden block of things that keep populating 
it seems like the block component should be responsible for: 

greying itself out as it advances
scrolling

put the block component instead a div
when it's out of new components to spawn, that should call pset.next()

stopped here:

If you think about it, the evidence bars should multiplicatively scale up your prior belief to form your new belief. This multiplication is something you can perform with your visual system.

What is the probability that Kahneman is in the cave if the weather is nice? (Hint: view the new belief tab to see how the widget would perform the calculation).


----

Bayes Rule says the evidence bars should multiplicatively scale up your prior belief to form your new belief. This multiplication is something you can perform with your visual system.

Click the button to show __.
THe proof of this is pretty simple ___ + will be covered in more detail in ___.


todo:

---

If the screen is wide enough, then push the text over when the belief is open

---
done:
add the percents onto the triple-bayes view
also add checkpointing onto the side panel
make sure that proportions work

be able to change the titles of prior belief/posterior belief to new belief/old belief

trying to propagate the app signal down to the child
would be nice that clicking outside one of the belifef things closes it

add pulsing to attract attention to the toggle butons

make the left:100px triple-bayes tighter so it's possibel to escape the window


---

stopped here:

smooth out the language / fix the math of the weather example
P(D|H)
P(H|D)


why does the story not consistently grey out the old boxes???
vue transition always goes down?





<!--If this is the monk's section.
Hey, higher education isn't free these days. You'll need to pay __ moneybags to graduate from this monastery -->


----

todo: think on the story

do we still want to add two guesses for the dist question?

add more story to the beginning of the monk chapter??
