moneybag:


======

new bias: small sample effect
new chapter: distributions
let people predict the outcome from an experiment
predict from a sequence of experiments

=====

default effect: can be made into a unit
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_effect


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insensitivity_to_sample_size



======

bayesian spreading:
bayesian spreading out of distribution

(1)
second best guess
mike -- that spreads out

(2)
choose a distribution
manipulate it
guessing game

scale everything up 1000


======

CIA world fact book


row of greyed out moneybags -- click a moneybag to submit your bet
submit

drag an existing moneybag


---

Make at least two guesses
If X isnt' the answer, what is the answer?
Choose a distribution that covers it

todo:

see which of the bayes problems actually work / which should be removed

weather is good

P(H|D) = P(D|H) * P(H)

P(H|D) --> P(cave|good weather) 

P(D|H) --> P(good weather|cave) 
P(D|H) --> P(good weather|tavern)


80% of the days he's in the cave, the weather is good.
20% of the days he's in )))

P(good weather AND cave) = P(cave|good ewather)
P(good weather AND tavern)

P(cave|good weather) = P(cave and good weather) / P(good weather)
Weather is good so 


adding hte click outside
make dropdown work better

stopped here: 

put in bayes widget
add moneybag unit


fix the text to make sense given the current ordering -- what should the current ordering be??


--

moneybag
bayes
belief as graphs

--

put in followup / signup page / thanks
figure out where we want to put the tests

---

too long and grindy
feedback from the google form:
do put in lower and upper bounds for the draggy thing
remove the google form
people didn't understand how it helps cog biases
bonus levels for bayes rule
unit problems for uncertainty questions

----

stopped here:
improve the story
make themoneybag into a "game"
feedback for user scores
unify the bayes colors with the distribution colors



stopped here:
figure out how to combine pset with a flow of questions

input-box is triggering next


---
ohh there is no higher pset within beliefs-as-dists....
pset is within!

---

how pset currently works:

- each child component calls pset.next() by looking up the DOM tree for the pset component

but now we have a hidden block of things that keep populating 
it seems like the block component should be responsible for: 

greying itself out as it advances
scrolling

put the block component instead a div
when it's out of new components to spawn, that should call pset.next()

stopped here:

If you think about it, the evidence bars should multiplicatively scale up your prior belief to form your new belief. This multiplication is something you can perform with your visual system.

What is the probability that Kahneman is in the cave if the weather is nice? (Hint: view the new belief tab to see how the widget would perform the calculation).


----

Bayes Rule says the evidence bars should multiplicatively scale up your prior belief to form your new belief. This multiplication is something you can perform with your visual system.

Click the button to show __.
THe proof of this is pretty simple ___ + will be covered in more detail in ___.


todo:

---

If the screen is wide enough, then push the text over when the belief is open

---
done:
add the percents onto the triple-bayes view
also add checkpointing onto the side panel
make sure that proportions work

be able to change the titles of prior belief/posterior belief to new belief/old belief

trying to propagate the app signal down to the child
would be nice that clicking outside one of the belifef things closes it

add pulsing to attract attention to the toggle butons

make the left:100px triple-bayes tighter so it's possibel to escape the window


---

stopped here:

smooth out the language / fix the math of the weather example
P(D|H)
P(H|D)


why does the story not consistently grey out the old boxes???
vue transition always goes down?





<!--If this is the monk's section.
Hey, higher education isn't free these days. You'll need to pay __ moneybags to graduate from this monastery -->


----

todo: think on the story

do we still want to add two guesses for the dist question?

add more story to the beginning of the monk chapter??

---

stopped here: playtest the new section so we can see how we want to order the story

who'd be good for this??

in either case, this is better than what we currently have...

---

draggable-dist y axis is a little weird

todo: figure out the two scales
baseWidth(){
  return lerp(this.conf[1]-this.conf[0], 0, 100, 50, this.chartWidth);
},

const spreadScale = d3.scalePow().exponent(3).range([0, 100]);
const spread = spreadScale(top/height);


what's up with:
var conf = [guess - mode*spread, guess + (1-mode)*spread];


can we fix this just by adding a constraint??

---

hmm:
the units towards graduation metric depends on the scale of the problem
so like, you get fewer points when it's num countries/num bones as opposed to percent...
--> what to do??

----


draggable-dist looks a lot better with a fixed constraint.
experiment with 

smooth out the language / fix the math of the weather example
P(D|H)
P(H|D)


add more story
add the icons back in

---

add google analytics to see far how people get
add thanks section


gtag('event', 'v2', {
  'event_category': 'read',
  'event_label': chapter_name,
  'value': 1
});

---draw the distributions


34 - 34 doesn't work 
makes a narrow skinny thing -- that's because there were restrictions on the cat thing

Fred playtest

(1)

why do you want to see in distributions if you want to learn about cognitive biases

how should i motivate distributions??
preferably with a cognitive bias

make up a cog bias?
Overconfidence -- 
express uncertainty


distributions allow you express uncertainty
it's like learning a language --- 
maybe motivate it from Superforecasters

can motivate discrete distributions which come up in the next chapter 
bayes rule bias


---

need more decimal points
1.2 0.3

could add validation to answers in distribution thing



(2)

unexpected that the cave/tavern got normalized there -- try normalizing upon submit. see what happens.




---

figuring out visual design given that we only have one character -- the monk

could change the font for monk

eh... should we just leave it? 
and kick out the door? 
font actually improves it a lot

we might need to add a few more pictures to improve it



---

smooth over the story
find another playtester
sounds are repetitive
visual design is a little bleh
not obvious that you have to drag the belief circle
adding more story to story aug 30.html
I think adding headers might help too

----

fixing the story

is the first unit about overconfidence bias or is it not?? -- it's not


monk is looking for a successor

what is monk looking for in a successor??
13 obstacles

the prophecies say that my successor will face a perilous journey and rid themselves of 13 biases.
tortured soul that needs to rid themselves of 13 biases.

13??!

well, the prophecy actually said 88, but I thought it would be better to reduce it to 13 or else I'd never find anyone.



very interesting... you have passed my first test.
you have to find kahneman who will administer a test of your abilities



strip out: 
  MONK: By the way, I think we might have reduced your susceptibility to the Overconfidence Bias...


consider fading away the next buton after it is clicked by default?

---



somehow it got offset --  there is 1 more clickable button than there s
add in sounds? 

stopped here:
stripping down
adding sound

should we investigate the scroll?

one idea to fix the scroll: always scroll twice


---


boris feedback:
want the post-oracle stuff to be more interactive
remove the points, or make it persist through the narrative
enter could scroll -- too much mousing
