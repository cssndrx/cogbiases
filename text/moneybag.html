You were last standing alone in a cave holding a scroll and calling out for Kahneman. 

The cave has shrunk and the walls have closed around your chest and other vital organs. You feel your heart thumping.

VOICE: Welcome to the Cave of Overconfidence.

VOICE: Did you know that most humans are overconfident?

You all tend to overestimate how good of a driver you are ___. 

You underestimate the amount of time it'll take to ___. 

And when you say you're __% sure, it turns out that you're only __% right. 

[Who are you?]
[Please let me go]

I'll let you go... for a price. 

How much money do you have on you? 

You feel around your pockets and realize that you've got money! Being good does pay off!

[I have 5 moneybags]

Ha. I was thinking... that I'd let you go for XXX moneybags. 

[But I don't have that many]

You can bet with me to earn more money...

But if you lose, *walls pulse threatening*.... well, you don't want to happen. 


How does this work??

The mysterious voice will ask you a question. 

Which is more popular?

[ice cream] [pizza]

But then more importantly, the voice will ask you how sure you are of your answer. 

[50%] [60%] []


(A)
The voice will convert your certainty into a payout. 

[[show payouts]]

Why are these the payouts? 

If you were really X% correct, ___. 

Why don't I just say I am 50% sure all the time, regardless of how sure I am.

You should answer honestly. If you don't, the voice will know... and then... 


----

The voice will judge your wisdom and let you go accordingly.

Your answer was correct/incorrect. The voice jots down your confidence.


Can you just multiply the certainty with 0/1??
You were on average __% sure. You were on average __% correct.

----

calibrated:
This is indeed pretty impressive for a human. 

overconfident:
You're a typical human, with more certainty than accuracy.

underconfident:
How unusual.... you were less certain than you were accurate. 


You may not need this following tool, but humor me. 
To better calibrate your certainty, think in terms of the fair bet instead. 

For instance, the bet:
Win 1 if right, 
Lose 1 if wrong

Corresponds to 50% certainty, because if you are correct 50% of the time, this bet would break even.

Win 1 if right, 
Lose 4 if wrong, 
Corresponds to 80% certainty, because if you are correct 80% of the time, this bet would break even.


Try it here, 

Which weighs more?
[Goat] [Sheep]

What would you like to wager? 

[bet] [bet] [bet]

Since you were correct/incorrect, you win __. 

[Why don't I always pick 50%]

Player, you should answer honestly. If the cave detects any dishonesty, *cave walls close in menancingly*.

[I'm ready]
