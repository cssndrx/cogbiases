MONK: Hello, young explorer....

MONK: I am training explorers like yourself to rid themselves of cognitive biases. Cognitive biases are instances in which humans consistently make irrational decisions. Would you like a lesson?

Oh, before we start... would you like a cookie? 

[It might be rude to refuse]

I have been in search for a successor for a long time. 

[Why?]

The world is in danger...

Through the Bystander Effect we have been ___ and might knock the world out of it's precarious balance. 

// other global warming biases

But before we worry about the biases of other people, let's work on the ones within ourselves. 


The first bias is so pervasive, that it's not formally recognized as a cognitive bias. I call it the Magic Answer Fallacy. 

It's the tendency to respond to questions with a simple "magic answer"> 

For instance, ___. 


The first step is to accept that most questions don't have magic answers. Most answers are uncertain, and that uncertainty means to get an accurate picture you should think in distributions.

MONK: When I first joined the monastery, I was searching for truth. I was looking for one "true answer" to every question I had. 

However, in my search, I have discovered that there is almost always uncertainty around beliefs and "answers". When I learned to model this uncertainty as <bold>distributions</bold>, that is when others say I became an old, wise monk. 

<next>Why would I want to do that?</next>

MONK: You do not need to be old, but seeing distributions may be a helpful concept. A distribution is a picture of uncertainty where the outcomes are on the x-axis, and the probabilities assigned to them are in the y-axis.

MONK: It allows you to shift from using language like "pretty sure", to knowing exactly what you think.

Now, practice thinking in distributions.

A test of your abilities??

MONK: Very good. To reach the next stage in your journey to reduce cognitive biases, you may want to seek out a figure named Kahneman. He will administer to you a test of your abilities.

MONK: His whereabouts have been unknown for some time, so good luck finding him.


And for the next few chapters you're just searching for Kahneman
